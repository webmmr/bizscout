# Project Overview

=====================

This project is a Next.js application built with Tailwind CSS, converting a Figma design into a responsive web app. The app features a mobile menu and utilizes mock static data for demonstration purposes. Notably, I deviated from the original design to improve the user experience by adjusting font sizes and spacing to better accommodate various screen sizes. The project focuses on responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen resolutions. No server side api call or routing is present in the project. all links are dummy links.
