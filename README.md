# Project Overview

=====================

This project is a Next.js application built with Tailwind CSS, converting a Figma design into a responsive web app. The app features a mobile menu and utilizes mock static data for demonstration purposes. Notably, I deviated from the original design to improve the user experience by adjusting font sizes and spacing to better accommodate various screen sizes. The project focuses on responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen resolutions. No server side api call or routing is present in the project. all links are dummy links.

The links on the left sidebar is redirectling to the root page right now as a mock. Ideally they will render individual pages in real world application. Also on the topbar nav it is not doing anything at the moment. In real world by clicking on them query will be setup in the url and page will display data accordingly.
